I attended the Lag and Crash 3.0 CTF and won 28th place with my team, I signed up as an individual and was placed in a team with 3 other members who also signed up as individuals.

It was my first time attending a CTF and I had a lot of fun learning and solving challenges. The CTF was a jeopardy-style CTF with challenges in various categories like Web, Forensics, Crypto, etc hosted by various Polytechnics in Singapore. I also wrote a writeup for one of the challenges I solved, you can read it above.
