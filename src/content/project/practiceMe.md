Co-Developed with a group of students to create a full stack gamified website fork of a command line tool aimed at helping SP students to enhance their Javascript skills. Utilised the NextJS framework, with PusherJs as a Websocket service and MongoDB as the database and Sanity CMS to push announcements more efficiently. Currently maintaining the project for future batches to be used in their Fundamentals of Programming module.
